***OVERVIEW***

The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent
functionality.

Thefunctions that the OS module provides allows you to interface with the
underlying operating system that pyhton is running on - be that Windows, Mac or
Linux.

You can find important information about your location or about the process.

In this post I will show some of these functions.

*OS.PATH.JOIN()*
Join one or more path components intelligently. This mthod concatenates path
components with exactly one directory separator ('/') following each non-empty
part except the last path component.
